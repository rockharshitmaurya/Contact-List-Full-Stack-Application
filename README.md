### Frontend and API URLs


- Backend Server URL : [https://contact-go.onrender.com](https://contact-go.onrender.com)
- Frontend URL : [https://contact-go.netlify.app](https://contact-go.netlify.app)

>Please note that the API is hosted on a free server, which means that it may take some time to handle the first request as the server might be in a sleep mode. Therefore, there could be some delay in response time. However, once the server is up, it should work fine. Thank you for your understanding
